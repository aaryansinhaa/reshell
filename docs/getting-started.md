# Getting Started

This guide covers requirements, installation, shell profile integration, and import/export commands.

## Requirements

- **Go**: Version 1.22 or higher.
- **Operating Systems**: Linux, macOS, or Windows (via PowerShell or Git Bash).
- **Git**: Required for configuration version control and importing marketplace packs.

---

## Installation & Setup

### Run via Docker (Sandbox Demo)

For testing or running ReShell in an isolated sandbox without affecting your host system, you can use the pre-built Docker image hosted on GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker run -it ghcr.io/aaryansinhaa/reshell:latest
```

### Build from Source

Build the binary from the repository root:

```bash
go build -o reshell
```

Initialize the global configuration, install the binary, and inject startup hooks:

```bash
./reshell setup
```

The `setup` command automatically copy-installs the `reshell` executable into your local user path (`~/.local/bin/`), registers the path variables, and injects the shell hook integrations. Open a new terminal window to begin using `reshell` globally.

---

## Active Shell Integration

reshell compiles your configurations and hooks them into your startup profile. Run:

```bash
reshell apply
```

This generates shell-specific script outputs and registers startup hooks:
- **Zsh**: Adds integration blocks to `~/.zshrc` and compiles imports to `~/.config/reshell/shell/reshell.sh`.
- **Bash**: Adds integration blocks to `~/.bashrc` and compiles imports to `~/.config/reshell/shell/reshell.sh`.
- **Fish**: Adds integration blocks to `~/.config/fish/config.fish` and compiles imports to `~/.config/reshell/shell/reshell.fish`.

### Startup Hook Structure

The injected configuration block in your shell profile:

```bash
# >>> reshell initialize >>>
if [ -f "$HOME/.config/reshell/shell/reshell.sh" ]; then
    . "$HOME/.config/reshell/shell/reshell.sh"
fi
# <<< reshell initialize <<<
```

To clean all reshell integration blocks and restore your profile files, run:

```bash
reshell clean
```

## Configuration Portability (Import & Export)

To prevent configuration drift, you can export and import your workspace configuration as a unified TOML manifest or back up the raw config folder.

### Conflict Resolution (Last-Write-Wins Policy)

reshell uses a **Last-Write-Wins (LWW)** conflict resolution policy when merging configurations:
- **Manifest Imports (`reshell import`)**: Overwrites the existing local configurations with the contents of the imported TOML manifest file.
- **Marketplace Packs (`reshell install`)**: Fetches the configuration pack manifest, presents a summary breakdown of all environment variables, aliases, snippets, custom functions, and library scripts to be installed, warns about running third-party scripts, and prompts for confirmation before merging. Merges are performed item-by-item. If an imported alias, environment variable, or snippet matches an existing local key, the imported value overwrites the local one.
- **Git Version Control**: Since reshell automatically commits all changes under `~/.config/reshell/`, you can inspect diffs and resolve conflicts or revert undesired overwrites using standard Git command-line tools.

### Exporting Configurations

To export environment variables, aliases, snippets, package lists, and workflows into a single TOML manifest:

```bash
reshell export ~/backup-config.toml
```

### Importing Configurations

To import configurations from a manifest and merge them with your current setup:

```bash
reshell import ~/backup-config.toml
```

Once imported, execute `reshell apply` to compile and source the new configuration.

---

## Dashboard Usage

To launch the interactive configuration editor, run the binary without any subcommands:

```bash
reshell
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Tab`: Navigate forward through sidebar tabs.
- `Shift+Tab`: Navigate backward through sidebar tabs.
- `Up / Down` (or `k / j`): Scroll item lists.
- `n`: Create a new entry (opens input form).
- `e`: Open the selected custom function or script in your default editor (`$EDITOR`).
- `d`: Delete the selected entry.
- `Space`: Toggle the active state of an environment variable or alias.
- `c`: Copy the selected script snippet to the system clipboard.
- `x`: Execute the selected script or workflow.
- `h` (inside Git tab): Toggle between global git configuration and local repository version history.
- `r` or `Enter` (inside Git history view): Revert configuration files to the selected revision.
- `Ctrl+A`: Run `reshell apply` to compile and load configurations.
- `q` or `Ctrl+C`: Exit the interface.

## Multi-Profile Workspaces

reshell supports isolated workspaces through **Profiles**. Each profile maintains its own custom aliases, snippets, custom function scripts, scripts library, environment variables, workflows, and package lists.

### Managing Profiles in TUI

Navigate to the **Profiles** tab in the TUI dashboard:
- **`s` or `Enter`**: Activates the highlighted profile and automatically compiles and updates your shell hooks (`reshell apply`).
- **`n`**: Prompts you for a name to create and switch to a new profile.
- **`d`**: Deletes the highlighted profile (you cannot delete the active profile).

### Managing Profiles in CLI

You can also control profiles directly from the command line:

- **List profiles**:
  ```bash
  reshell profile list
  ```
- **Create profile**:
  ```bash
  reshell profile create work
  ```
- **Switch profile**:
  ```bash
  reshell profile switch work
  ```
- **Delete profile**:
  ```bash
  reshell profile delete work
  ```

### Isolated Version Control Histories

Each configuration profile maintains its own **completely isolated Git history**:
- Custom profiles store their version histories inside `~/.config/reshell/profiles/<name>/.git/`.
- The default profile stores its history at the root of `~/.config/reshell/.git/` and automatically ignores custom profiles to prevent overlap.
- Swapping profiles switches the TUI History panel to show commits specific to that profile only.

#### Clearing Version History

If you want to discard your profile's version control history and start fresh with a clean initial snapshot:
- **TUI Dashboard**: Go to the **Git** tab, toggle **History View** (using `h`), and press **`c`**.
- **CLI Terminal**: Run the following subcommand:
  ```bash
  reshell git clear
  ```
