Welcome to the reshell documentation. reshell is a portable configuration and command-line workspace manager for developers.

reshell centralizes your shell configurations, including environment variables, command aliases, script snippets, custom shell functions, system packages, and git profiles into a single, version-controlled configuration directory.

## Document Sections

1. **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)**: Requirements, installation, profile integration, and configuration import/export.
2. **[Snippets & Aliases](snippets-aliases.md)**: Managing code blocks, clipboard interactions, and command conflict checks.
3. **[Functions, Scripts & Workflows](functions-scripts.md)**: Writing custom shell functions, script parameters parsing, and workflow step execution.
4. **[Packages & Marketplace](package-marketplace.md)**: System dependency synchronization, sudo password piping, and third-party configuration packs.

## Design Principles

- **Declarative Configuration**: All configurations are stored as human-readable TOML files under `~/.config/reshell`. No binary databases or external registries are used.
- **Subshell Isolation Avoidance**: To allow configurations (like directory changes or environment updates) to affect the active terminal, reshell generates native scripts that are sourced directly by your shell profile.
- **Secure Privilege Elevation**: Operations requiring administrative privileges prompt for authorization at runtime, avoiding running the main application as root.
- **Portability**: All settings are packaged into structured files, allowing environment synchronization across new installations without configuration drift.
