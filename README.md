reshell is a portable developer environment and command-line workspace manager. It provides a terminal dashboard to configure, track, and synchronize aliases, script snippets, shell functions, environment variables, system packages, and git configurations from a single, version-controlled configuration directory.

---

## Environment Bootstrapping

Setting up a new machine or server environment often requires hours of copying dotfiles, writing custom shell scripts, and installing dependencies individually. 

`reshell` automates this process into a single command. By importing pre-configured workspace packs from the marketplace or any Git repository, you can configure aliases, environment variables, custom helper scripts, and system package dependencies instantly.

### Example: Java Developer Workspace

To install a complete developer environment:

```bash
reshell install github.com/aaryansinhaa/reshell-java
```

Under the hood, this command:
1. Clones the remote repository and parses the `reshell.toml` manifest.
2. Merges development configurations:
   * **Aliases**: Binds shortcuts like `jrun` (`java -jar`).
   * **Environment Variables**: Sets paths like `JAVA_HOME`.
   * **Code Snippets**: Adds helper commands like `mvn-clean-install`.
   * **Custom Functions**: Copies shell functions to `~/.config/reshell/functions/`.
3. Appends required packages to the configuration manifest:
   ```toml
   packages = ["openjdk-17-jdk", "maven", "gradle"]
   ```

To install the missing dependencies and apply the configurations:

```bash
reshell install
```

`reshell` detects the host package manager (`apt`, `brew`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `winget`), prompts for administrative elevation if required, and installs the dependencies asynchronously.

## Features

- **CLI Dashboard**: Terminal user interface for managing configurations.
- **Setup Wizard**: Detects installed text editors (Neovim, VS Code, Nano, etc.) to set editor preferences automatically.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Real-time rendering for scripts, custom functions, and TOML templates.
- **Workspace Workflows**: Non-blocking, multi-step command and browser automation routines.
- **Cross-Platform Package Manager**: Asynchronously installs and uninstalls host packages on Linux, macOS, and Windows with secure sudo password piping.
- **Shell Compiler**: Generates optimized setup scripts and automatically registers startup hooks in `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `config.fish`.
- **Portable Configurations**: Import or export configuration directories as a single TOML manifest. Configuration merges use a **Last-Write-Wins** policy, where matching incoming elements overwrite existing local settings.
- **Workspace Version Control**: Automatically tracks configuration files and custom scripts in a local Git repository, with TUI controls to view history and revert changes.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.22 or higher
- Git

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaryansinhaa/reshell.git
cd reshell
go build -o reshell
```

### Setup
Configure global binary path hooks and profile integrations:
```bash
./reshell setup
```
The setup command installs the `reshell` executable to `~/.local/bin/` and registers the startup hooks in your shell profile.
