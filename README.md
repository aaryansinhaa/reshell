- **CLI Dashboard**: Terminal user interface for managing configurations.
- **Setup Wizard**: Detects installed text editors (Neovim, VS Code, Nano, etc.) to set editor preferences automatically.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Real-time rendering for scripts, custom functions, and TOML templates.
- **Workspace Workflows**: Non-blocking, multi-step command and browser automation routines.
- **Cross-Platform Package Manager**: Asynchronously installs and uninstalls host packages on Linux, macOS, and Windows with secure sudo password piping.
- **Shell Compiler**: Generates optimized setup scripts and automatically registers startup hooks in `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `config.fish`.
- **Portable Configurations**: Import or export configuration directories as a single TOML manifest or ZIP file.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.22 or higher
- Git

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaryansinhaa/reshell.git
cd reshell
go build -o reshell
```

### Setup
Configure global binary path hooks and profile integrations:
```bash
./reshell setup
```
The setup command installs the `reshell` executable to `~/.local/bin/` and registers the startup hooks in your shell profile.
