reshell is a portable developer environment and command-line workspace manager. It provides a terminal dashboard to configure, track, and synchronize aliases, script snippets, shell functions, environment variables, system packages, and git configurations from a single, version-controlled configuration directory.

## Environment Bootstrapping

Setting up a new machine or server environment often requires hours of copying dotfiles, writing custom shell scripts, and installing dependencies individually. 

`reshell` automates this process into a single command. By importing pre-configured workspace packs from the marketplace or any Git repository, you can configure aliases, environment variables, custom helper scripts, and system package dependencies instantly.

### Example: Java Developer Workspace

To install a complete developer environment:

```bash
reshell install github.com/aaryansinhaa/reshell-java
```

reshell automatically:
1. Clones the remote repository and parses the `reshell.toml` manifest.
2. Merges development configurations:
   * **Aliases**: Binds shortcuts like `jrun` (`java -jar`).
   * **Environment Variables**: Sets paths like `JAVA_HOME`.
   * **Code Snippets**: Adds helper commands like `mvn-clean-install`.
   * **Custom Functions**: Copies shell functions to `~/.config/reshell/functions/`.
3. Appends required packages to the configuration manifest:
   ```toml
   packages = ["openjdk-17-jdk", "maven", "gradle"]
   ```

To install the missing dependencies and apply the configurations:

```bash
reshell install
```

`reshell` detects the host package manager (`apt`, `brew`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `winget`), prompts for administrative elevation if required, and installs the dependencies asynchronously.

## Features

- **CLI Dashboard**: Terminal user interface for managing configurations.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Real-time rendering for scripts, custom functions, and TOML templates.
- **Workspace Workflows**: Non-blocking, multi-step command and browser automation routines.
- **Cross-Platform Package Manager**: Asynchronously installs and uninstalls host packages on Linux, macOS, and Windows with secure sudo password piping.
- **Shell Compiler**: Generates optimized setup scripts and automatically registers startup hooks in `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `config.fish`.
- **Portable Configurations**: Import or export configuration directories as a single TOML manifest. Note that the configuration merge overwrites the existing settings, but you can revert those using the version control available inside reshell.
- **Workspace Version Control**: Automatically tracks configuration files and custom scripts in a local Git repository, with TUI controls to view history and revert changes.

## Installation & Setup

### Run via Docker (Sandbox Demo)

For testing or running ReShell in an isolated sandbox without affecting your host system, you can use the pre-built Docker image hosted on GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker run -it ghcr.io/aaryansinhaa/reshell:latest
```

This starts an interactive Ubuntu container with `reshell` pre-installed, a default non-root user (`developer`), and common shell dependencies configured.

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaryansinhaa/reshell.git
cd reshell
go build -o reshell
```

### Setup
Configure global binary path hooks, profile integrations, and automatically import configurations:
```bash
./reshell setup [directory_path]
```
The setup command:
1. Installs the `reshell` executable to `~/.local/bin/` and registers startup hooks in your shell profile.
2. Prompts you to select or create a target configuration profile (default: `default`).
3. Auto-discovers and imports configurations:
   - If `directory_path` is provided, scans that folder recursively.
   - If no path is provided, scans default system shell profiles (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, etc.), recursively scans `~/.config` (skipping large folders), global VS Code user snippets, and Pet TOML configuration files.
4. Performs interactive de-duplication, conflict resolution (allowing you to choose between overriding, keeping existing, renaming, or skipping), and secure secret detection (skipped by default).
